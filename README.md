# Electric Vehicle Market Analysis Using Python
[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajay160/electric-vehicles-market-size)

# Description:
This project delves into the world of the electric vehicles (EV) market by analyzing a dataset from Kaggle. Using Python libraries and guided by data science principles, we will identify areas where the industry can reduce costs and increase revenue. This exploration will aid in understanding market dynamics and potentially inform strategic business decisions in the EV sector.

### Technologies:
**Python (Data analysis and visualization) Libraries:** Pandas (Data manipulation), NumPy (Numerical computing), Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data visualization)

## Analysis:
For the task of market size of electric vehicles analysis, we can explore the following areas:

1. EV Adoption Over Time: Analyze the growth of the EV population by model year.

2. Geographical Distribution: Understand where EVs are most commonly registered (e.g., by county or city).

3. EV Types: Breakdown of the dataset by electric vehicle type (BEV, etc.).

4. Make and Model Popularity: Identify the most popular makes and models among the registered EVs.

5. Electric Range Analysis: Analyze the electric range of vehicles to see how EV technology is progressing.

6. Estimated Growth in Market Size: Analyze and find the estimated growth in the market size of electric vehicles.
   
Let’s start with analyzing the EV Adoption Over Time by visualizing the number of EVs registered by model year. It will give us an insight into how the EV population has grown over the years:

**1)EV Adoption Over Time:**

From the above bar chart, it’s clear that EV adoption has been increasing over time, especially noting a significant upward trend starting around 2016. The number of vehicles registered grows modestly up until that point and then begins to rise more rapidly from 2017 onwards. The year 2023 shows a particularly sharp increase in the number of registered EVs, with the bar for 2023 being the highest on the graph, indicating a peak in EV adoption.

Now, let’s start by selecting the top 3 counties based on EV registrations and then analyze the distribution of EVs within the cities of those counties:
